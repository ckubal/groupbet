## Data Models

Key interfaces following the technical specification:

- **Game**: NFL game with betting lines and status
- **Bet**: Individual bet with participants and financial details
- **User**: Friend group member with PIN authentication
- **Weekend**: NFL week grouping with status tracking
- **Settlement**: End-of-week payment calculations

## Caching Strategy

To preserve API quota and improve performance:

1. **The Odds API**: 5-minute cache for betting lines
2. **ESPN API**: 30-second cache for live games, 30-minute for completed games
3. **Manual refresh**: Users can force refresh to get latest data
4. **Intelligent expiration**: Different cache durations based on game status

## Development

### Running the app
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run start        # Start production server
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
```

### API Usage Monitoring

The app logs API usage to the console:
- The Odds API request counts and remaining quota
- Cache hit/miss information
- Error handling for rate limits

## Security

- Environment variables protected by `.gitignore`
- No API keys in source code
- Cookie-based user sessions (no sensitive data)
- Client-side API calls only for public sports data

## Firebase Setup (Next Phase)

When ready to set up Firebase:
1. Create a new Firebase project called "GroupBet"
2. Enable Firestore Database
3. Add your Firebase config to `.env.local`
4. Deploy Firestore security rules
